My Thought Processes

## Thought Process
Work top to bottom

make sure everything works

Make a little animation happen

style

### Why
why this animation: looks like some typing, fits the theme of programmer

why this color: i emplied the purple because it is one of my favorite colors and makes it a bit more colorful

why this style: thought it was a classy little style that could show a bit of what i am and can achieve

#### Explaination
I established my pages into components and implemented them all into my home page and navigation bar, I did this to facilitate focus per page and make it more accessible and pleasant on mobile
since they can also just scroll down to see the content.

I used router, routes, route from react-router-dom to link all my components together on the app.js file.

I decided to showcase my projects in the form of videos so that the viewers/users feel more at ease with just one click they can view several aspects of my previous works.

I created a form on my contact page to make the viewer/user feel like they can easily reach out and see my potential skills in form making. I wish to make it functional by using the react POST and GET methods in the future and also be able to link a source to my email directly to simplify it for the viewer/user and myself.

I made sure to style all my work with styled compontents this always me to go through my code and view it more clearly in the event that i would need to modify any little aspect of my portfolio website in the future wether by adding or removing content.

I created a desktop first approach of my portfolio website because that is what i am most familliar with and i belive as a web developer desktop websites are more likely to be viewed on a computer/Laptop then on any other device, although i did love creating a website i could see through multiple different platforms.

For easier accessibility for the viewer/user i made the navigation bar fixed so that it follows the user/viewer on the page on whichever page they are interessted by and also remains at the top of the screen if the user simply scrolls down or up on any of the pages for easier access at anytime the viewer/user needs or wants.

The animation i used was a typing animation on and infinity loop so that it looks as if it is being written/edited at the same time as the viewer/user is in use of my portfolio website. This approach was thought of in a way to make it more interesting to view the site and more interactive with the words and makes it more attracting and pleasing to look at.

I used this picture of me because it was minimalistic with colors yes still vibrant enough to follow the theme of my portfolio website which in this case was grey, black, white and a surrounding of purple to make it more attractive and eye catching. The reason for my choice with the grey, balck and white is because it is classy and minimalistic and also has this relaxing tone to it so that the viewers/users feel welcome to stay as long as they want.
